            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of <hi>Susanna Smith,</hi> Widow and Executrix of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Smith,</hi> Esq; late Accomptant General, and Comptroller of His Majesty's Revenue in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who Died in that Service in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Year, <hi>1689.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>WILLIAM Ellis</hi> Esq; afterwards Sir <hi>William Ellis</hi> Kt. Borrowed of the said Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> Five Hundred Pounds, and for the Security thereof, Entred into a Bond Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 12. <hi>January,</hi> 1686/7. of the Penalty of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Payment of the said 500 l. on 16. <hi>October</hi> then next Ensuing, with a Warrant of Attorney to Confess Judgment thereupon.</p>
            <p>Which Judgment not being Entred, and the Troubles coming on in that Kingdom, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was forced to come into <hi>England,</hi> he did apply himself to Sir <hi>William Ellis</hi> for the said Money, or further Security for the same, who thereupon did by his Deed, Dated, 21 <hi>February</hi> 1688. Mortgage and Assign to the said Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in St. <hi>Georges-Lane,</hi> two Houses in <hi>Dames-Street,</hi> and One on <hi>Arran</hi>'s-<hi>Key,</hi> which, with the Bond aforesaid, was all the Security he had for the said Money.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Rout at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> there being a Commission of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry for finding the Estates of several Persons concerned in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the said Deed of Mortgage was produced to the Court, and the same, being made out and Proved, was found by the Jury, and Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so on the Inquisition, and thereupon, and pursuant to a Clause in the said Deed, Mrs. <hi>Smith</hi> did Enter into the said Houses, for securing as well the said Five Hundred Pounds, as for Satisfaction of the Arrears of Interest, which are considerable.</p>
            <p>That several Sums have been expended in Repairing the said Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whereof some lay Waste, and those that were Inhabited, were so much Ruined, and the Tenants Impoverished in the Troubles, that very little Rent could be received thereout; And when the Tenants came to be in a Condition to Pay something, several Judgments, Prior to the Mortgage, were Executed thereon, so that of the Rent of the said Houses, only Fifteen Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> hath been received, and for these Two Years past the Tenants have refused to Pay any part of the Rent.</p>
            <p>That Mrs. <hi>Smith</hi> Exhibited her Claim before the Honourable Trustees for Forfeited Estates, who were sensible of the Justice and Equity of her Case, and the Hardships she was under, having not any thing else left her for her Support and Maintenance; but could not Relieve her, by reason that the Act of Parliament for the Forfeitures took Place Eight Days before the Date of the Deed of Mortgage; The said Act Commencing the 13. of <hi>February,</hi> 1688. And the said Deed Eight Days after, <hi>viz.</hi> the 21. of the same Month, although the Money was really Lent, and Bond given near Two Years before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore, It is humbly hoped, That the Honourable House of Commons will take this hard Case into their favourable Consideration, and Grant such Relief therein, as to their Great Wisdoms shall seem Meet.</hi>
